# Finite Automata

Finite automata = can be implementation of regex

They both can specify the regular languages. Simply think about it as a character by character analysis of a string. This can also be thought of/implemented as a set of nested switch statements and state variables. Implementation can be boiled down to a lookup table, also.

|Finite automata has..|Symbol|
|--|--|
|An input alphabet|∑|
|A set of states|S|
|A start state|n|
|A set of accepting states|F⊆S|
|A set of transitions from state to state|state →<sup>input</sup> state


**Transitions**
* Defined as: S<sub>1</sub> →<sup>a</sup> S<sub>2</sub>
* Read as: In state S<sub>1</sub> on input a go to state S<sub>2</sub>

**Accept/Reject**
* If we at the **end of input** and in **accepting state** => accept
* Otherwise => reject
